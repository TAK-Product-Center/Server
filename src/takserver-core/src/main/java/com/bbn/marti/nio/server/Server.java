/**
* Interface for a nio server that is controlled through a bind/listen/stop sequence as a persistent service, 
* and through register/deregister/modify change operations as an event publisher on the channels it regulates.
*
* <p> The server is responsible for handling scheduling and guaranteeing ordering of calls. See {@link SchedulingStrategy},
* where the server makes different guarantees about different scheduling strategies in terms of the number of threads servicing
* a type of request at a given time.
*
* <p> Channel registration/deregistration and modification of interest is done asynchronously, with the listenable future triggered
* when the operation is completed, or when an exception is generated. ChannelHandlers should be made resilient to unwanted calls that 
* occur between the time when the change  request is submitted, and the time when the server processes it. 
* The Server does guarantee that InterestOp modifications are applied in the order they were received (subject to a happens before 
* relation with the entry and exit of the server's submit method call.
