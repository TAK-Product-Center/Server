/**
* Interface for a handler that receives notifications of socket layer events being published by the server 
* (see the handle_ class of calls), and receives application-side calls for high-level io operations and queries.
*
* The Server (NioServer) is responsible for maintaining the selector, and calls into a handler when io events
* that the handler has subscribed to (on its registered selectable channel)
*
* Channel handlers are guaranteed that:
*
* -- Only one thread (the server thread) will be entrant in a single handle_ call at a given time, such that each
* call is subject to a happens-before relationship. As long as in handling the io call, the channel handler emits
* an event into any processing framework that guarantees linearity (subject to linearity of submission), then 
* connection-oriented protocols can ensure in-order processing of data.
*
* -- The methods corresponding to Read/Write/Connect/Accept will be called only if a channel is registered for that 
* interest op, and a selection key is triggered for that interest op, ie. the OS sends a notification that a given
* interest can be acted upon. The offending channel/server pair are passed into the handle_ call.
*
* -- (that said,) ChannelHandlers should be made resilient to spurious calls for events after they have been unsubscribed or removed from the server,
* as submission and processing of registration/interest op modifications are asynchronous.
*
*
* <p> ChannelHandlers are responsible for internally tracking their own channel ownership, as the Server does not maintain a map
* of handlers to the channels they own. The Server can only modify the interest ops or deregister a channel when given a direct reference 
* to a specific channel. A static ChannelHandler can be used for a group of channels, as any downstream
* functionality is not specified by this interface. In practice, current implementations always construct a chain of
